 * Repairing and repainting what the file shipped with.

 * A supplied model is authored for whatever renderer its author had, so some
 * of what it carries is wrong here and some of it is missing: normals averaged
 * across an edge that should be sharp, a material set up for a pipeline that
 * is not this one, and no notion at all of the finish a user is about to pick.
 * None of this changes the geometry, only how it is read.

 * A model that welds a flat panel to its rounded bevel leaves the corner
 * vertices holding an average of both, so the flat face shades as a gradient
 * between them — a soft fan spreading from a corner, on a surface that should
 * be uniform. Recomputing with a crease threshold splits the sharp edges and
 * leaves the fillets smooth.
 *
 * The geometry is cloned first because `Object3D.clone` shares it with the
 * parsed model in the cache, and this must not reach another scene.
